Analysing the Twitter Search Network and Facebook Like/Comment Network for Two Recent Movies: The Hobbit and The Interview

This is a project for a class called Web Science, which I followed at TU Wien, during the winter semester of 2014 [1]. In this repo you can find the original project and presentation and a latex source and resulting PDF which containt a summarized paper about the project. The latex source uses Springer [2] format and guidlines.
